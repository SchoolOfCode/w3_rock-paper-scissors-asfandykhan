## Planning

The planning stage for this challenge took much longer than expected. Especially the first few tasks. It was only once I began pair programming with another bootcamper that we were able to understand the tasks better between us.
The best way to implement js calling on the html required some additional attention too.

## Actual code

The code had a few changes over the length of the challenge:

- The initial logic was written in an if statement but I opted to use a switch statement since it was neater
- Different ways to link the r,p or s buttons and process the js code were used. but the final version was to make 3 seperate functions that called on other functions defined earlier in the code.

## Take aways for future projects and challenges:

- Pair programming is definitely more helpful than programming alone.
- Its better to make the code look neater once my code actually works, even if it doesn't look great.
- Its better to push up my code little and often than it is to push it all up in one go.
